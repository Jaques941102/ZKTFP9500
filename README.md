# ZKTFP9500
Alteration to ZKT's implementation that does not implement system Form messages

Please note that the Demo2.sln project is the SDK provided by ZKTeco to run with ZK9500 devices. A slight alteration has been made due to other windows applications posting kernel based messages, causing a unncessecary processor overhead in the implementing program.
